 PySimpleGUI PDFtoDOC

 This Python program uses PyPDF and PyDoc to convert handwritten notes into a clean typed Word document.

 I updated this program using PySimpleGUI. 

 Under the dist folder, there is a stand-alone EXE for Windows. This home has been tested on Windows 11. This is what I developed the application for. 

 I am posting this application as Open Source for whoever wants to learn from it or use it as you wish. 

 If you have any questions please message me.
